# DC Monitor 2

This application is designed to monitor different equipment, like Servers, Routers, Switches and so on, by IPMI, iLo or SNMP.

This is Opensource project based on my other project written in Python. That version is very hard to develop as I made some design mistakes, which I will try to bypass. Also, I want to make this project more asynchronous, so that each request to monitored equipment been made completely separately.

## Goals of the project

Why do I want to make one more monitoring utility? Well, in fact there is no any lightweight utility to monitor really big number of servers through IPMI: to get there sensors, event logs, handle their events and alert admins. In my own experience, often troubles can be predicted much earlier if you get low level data such as IPMI Event logs and sensors.

Client side is written using Knockout.js to render data recieved from server by Websockets events. Interface is fast, lightweight and simple, created with Semantic-UI.

You can watch the video of working system on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/BzZPdpnv_Y0).

## Install

Instruction is for Debian. You can use Linux distribution of your own.
```bash
apt-get install openjdk-7-jre mysql-server redis-server
```
